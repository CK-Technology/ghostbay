## Overview

**GhostBay** is a modern, self-hostable, **S3-compatible object storage system** built in Rust.
Think of it as a **developer-friendly MinIO alternative** with Ghost-ecosystem integrations.

Designed for speed, resilience, and simplicity: whether you’re backing up a personal project or running multi-petabyte clusters, GhostBay provides secure, scalable storage you can actually control.
