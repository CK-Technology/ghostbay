# TODO â€” GhostBay Phase 2 (Production-Ready S3 Storage)

**Status**: âœ… **MVP Complete!** Basic S3-compatible object storage is working with CLI and HTTP API.

**What Works Now:**
- âœ… Multi-crate Rust workspace architecture 
- âœ… Basic S3 API (bucket/object CRUD operations)
- âœ… Local filesystem storage engine with atomic writes
- âœ… SQLite catalog with migrations
- âœ… CLI for bucket management
- âœ… HTTP server with health checks
- âœ… Streaming upload/download
- âœ… Basic metadata handling (ETags, Content-Type)

**Current Test Success:**
```bash
ghostbay bucket create test-bucket        # âœ… Working
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/mybucket # âœ… Working  
curl http://localhost:3000/mybucket/file.txt # âœ… Working
```
